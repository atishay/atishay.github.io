My name is Atishay and I am a JavaScript developer. A few years back, if I said this, someone would have thought - what&amp;rsquo;s this guy doing in a Cisco conference. Will he be going to a lawyer&amp;rsquo;s conference next to preach them to convert from legalese. The web developer community has changed a lot from the cult of people copying and pasting scripts from google.

Performance is a mindset, a way of living, a choice that needs a decision very early in a product life cycle. Once the foundation is ready, and a palace built on those foundations, you cannot dig them out and live in the palace at the same time.</description></item><item><title>Meeting Roles and Responsibilities</title><link>https://atishay.me/blog/2019/04/21/meeting-roles-and-responsibilities/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@atishay.me (Atishay Jain)</author><guid>https://atishay.me/blog/2019/04/21/meeting-roles-and-responsibilities/</guid><description>Fellow members. Raise your hand if you have gone through the experience of getting custom tailor made dresses or have seen an arranged marriage. What do you think is common in these experiences with toastmasters. The awkward state of being measured constantly. It is difficult to be the center of attention. You get a feeling that your flaws are getting exaggerated and they will get reported at the end. The thing about custom tailor made clothing and arranged marriages is that, you do it because you need support.</description></item><item><title>Evaluate to motivate</title><link>https://atishay.me/blog/2019/04/14/evaluate-to-motivate/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@atishay.me (Atishay Jain)</author><guid>https://atishay.me/blog/2019/04/14/evaluate-to-motivate/</guid><description>Evaluation is a major part of a members toastmasters experience. It is a great honor to be an evaluator. Being an evaluator is a responsibility and doing it right is essential for the club to be successful. Evaluations improve our listening and impromptu skills and provide learning opportunities for everyone in the meeting. Raise your hand if you have had evaluations that have had a major impact on your speaking? Raise a hand if you have had underwhelming evaluations where you would desired more feedback.</description></item><item><title>Broadcast yourself</title><link>https://atishay.me/blog/2019/03/30/broadcast-yourself/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@atishay.me (Atishay Jain)</author><guid>https://atishay.me/blog/2019/03/30/broadcast-yourself/</guid><description>Let me introduce you to this gentlemen.

As soon we move to doing some back-end, we realize the inherent complexities of asynchronous programming.
The shared data problem One of the most important problems in asynchronous programming is the shared data or the critical region problem. To understand this problem have a look at the following figure:
Shared Data Problem In this figure we have stateful APIs from the data store with the basic access to read and write but no in-built transaction support.</description></item><item><title>Method wrappers in Async Await - Part III</title><link>https://atishay.me/blog/2019/03/20/method-wrappers-in-async-await-part-iii/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@atishay.me (Atishay Jain)</author><guid>https://atishay.me/blog/2019/03/20/method-wrappers-in-async-await-part-iii/</guid><description>In the previous post we used memoize to prevent the parallel calls to a function.

We could abstract out shared functionality over methods with a defined signature in a wrapper and not have to repeat the same tasks again and again. The semantics of methods having return values that need to be returned sometime makes regular use cases of calling methods without wrappers cumbersome. In the world of JavaScript, methods like debounce and throttle have been popular since the very beginning of the programming language.</description></item><item><title>Summer - Table Topics questions</title><link>https://atishay.me/blog/2019/03/15/summer-table-topics-questions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2019 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@atishay.me (Atishay Jain)</author><guid>https://atishay.me/blog/2019/03/15/summer-table-topics-questions/</guid><description>Introduction Summer is a very important season.

Indeed, this is the first time I am writing this post.</description></item><item><title>SMART</title><link>https://atishay.me/blog/2017/12/10/smart/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@atishay.me (Atishay Jain)</author><guid>https://atishay.me/blog/2017/12/10/smart/</guid><description>Here are the contents of my CC#10. Timed right before the new year, this speech explores setting up successful goals and achieving them.
I was looking through my files last week when I fell upon a rusty old document lying there. It was my new year’s resolution from last January. It was not a great sight. Do I look better than Brad Pitt? No. Am I richer than Bill Gates. No.</description></item><item><title>Toastmasters should be banned</title><link>https://atishay.me/blog/2017/11/19/toastmasters-should-be-banned/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@atishay.me (Atishay Jain)</author><guid>https://atishay.me/blog/2017/11/19/toastmasters-should-be-banned/</guid><description>Friends. You know America maintains a list of banned organizations that we as residents are not allowed to join. How many of you think toastmasters should in there? How many are with me on this - toastmasters should be banned. I am surprised. Are you sure&amp;hellip; No one. Do you all think the weapon of public speaking should not be licensed? Well, I need to open your eyes.

You are picked up unprepared and told to speak on things you never thought you would speak on. We have been working hard to make it more interesting - getting people to really think on the fly by not letting them tapping into their speeches and past table topics by providing interesting situations to speak about. Here are some sample questions I created for a session I hosted.</description></item><item><title>Easy Deep Learning Part X</title><link>https://atishay.me/blog/2017/09/21/deep-learning-part-10/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@atishay.me (Atishay Jain)</author><guid>https://atishay.me/blog/2017/09/21/deep-learning-part-10/</guid><description>Tips from the experts This is the tenth part of a multi-part series on deep learning. You should start with Part 1.
Recap So far we have looked at dense and convolutional neural networks. Then we tried our hands with transfer learning, that is using a pre-trained complicated model and tuning it to our different data set and getting wonderful results for that data set.
In this post we look at the identifying characteristics and new techniques that we can pick up from the best papers in the image-net challenge.</description></item><item><title>Easy Deep Learning Part IX</title><link>https://atishay.me/blog/2017/09/19/deep-learning-part-9/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@atishay.me (Atishay Jain)</author><guid>https://atishay.me/blog/2017/09/19/deep-learning-part-9/</guid><description>Using the model library This is the ninth part of an intended multi-part series on deep learning.

You should start with Part 1.
Recap By now you should be comfortable with what a neuron is, what a neural network (or a stack of neuron means). We have so far described a neuron to represent g(AX + b) which was chained together in multiple layers that created a deep network. Next we talked about concepts like dropout, different activation function, regularization and different initialization to get better results.</description></item><item><title>Easy Deep Learning Part VI</title><link>https://atishay.me/blog/2017/08/29/deep-learning-part-6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@atishay.me (Atishay Jain)</author><guid>https://atishay.me/blog/2017/08/29/deep-learning-part-6/</guid><description>Contracts, Options and Futures This is the sixth part of an intended multi-part series on deep learning. You should start with Part 1.
Recap In the previous posts we came up with the equation of a neuron to be f(X) = g(Ax + b) and talked about how we can stack one neuron over other to get a chain and make the network deep. We also talked about SGD and how we can slowly change our random parameters to get to the correct answer by going in the direction of the gradient.</description></item><item><title>Easy Deep Learning Part V</title><link>https://atishay.me/blog/2017/08/24/deep-learning-part-5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@atishay.me (Atishay Jain)</author><guid>https://atishay.me/blog/2017/08/24/deep-learning-part-5/</guid><description>Lets go Deep This is the fifth part of an intended multi-part series on deep learning.

Why blog? Why now? What has changed?
Blogging is one of the corner stones of the wild west of the Internet.</description></item></channel></rss>
