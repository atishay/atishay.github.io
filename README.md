[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/atishay/atishay.github.io.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/atishay/atishay.github.io)

Source code for my personal website: http://atishay.me.

Build with ❤️ using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), HTML and CSS. Images are attributed inline. A lot of cool css tricks from all over the internet especially, css-tricks.com.

Feel free to fork and play with it. Once you wish to deploy, pop me an email. I won't stop you and you are free to do what you want with it. All I want is information and proper credits (with SEO - no funny stuff like noreferrer).

The theme is custom and present in the themes folder. The content is cleanly separated from the theme. Will fork ou the theme into its own repo once I have completed the other pending tasks listed in its todo list.

This code is optimized for static websites and there has been concious effort to avoid JS and hard coding. The math is rendered during compilation as are guitar tabs. CSS Hackery is preferred to JS. Poly-fills are not used. Most modern browsers should work fine, tested with Safari, Chrome and Firefox. It may behave different on different browsers.
