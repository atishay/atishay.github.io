I am officially back after a full almost 3 year break from the website. This great hiatus has seen Hugo in Action going from a draft proposal to a published book, world going in and out of Covid and my personal life getting through the beautiful phase of the birth of twins to them almost reaching the age of three.

Lets hope I can continue writing (and do not tinker this website again as I have learned a lot about Hugo with my book and it has improved a lot) for a while. I know most of the stuff on my website has gotten very stale and the world has moved on from what it was back in 2019. But that's okay. This open book remains as the means for me to relive and remember what I grew up from.

This break also gave me an opportunity to see if my choice of framework for my website was wise. So here are my results:

* The total amount of time spent on maintaining my website during the break = 0. (:+1:)
* Hugo moved from `0.60` to `0.101` while I was gone. While Hugo 60 continued to build this, with Hugo 101, I go no errors and the website continued to compiled and run. (:+1:)
* The undocumented google forms API that used for my comments (I did not have Netlify forms for them as I wrote about in Hugo for action) - continued to work but I have tons of spam comments with 0 real ones. I will have to think if I need comments in the future. (:-1:)
* My comment script had a bug around parsing time (Either I did not test it or google changed its time format). Minor inconvenience but a great learning - stay on the official APIs. (:-1:)
* The website had a lot of clones (thanks Hugo in Action). My GitHub LFS quota was out - needed to purchase more to be able to clone. (:-1:)
* Number of security issues reported = 0 (:+1:)
* My CI continued to work  (:+1:)
* My 59 posts are still intact  (:+1:)
* I am able to start with the next one within a couple of hours of being back  (:+1:)

**Overall**: Pretty happy. This went pretty well. Hugo is there for the long run.
