Hugo in Action teaches you to build and host your own fully customizable static website with the Hugo engine. This friendly tutorial teaches you step-by-step how to use Hugo as a Content Management System and as a  web development environment. With a complete company example website and source code, you’ll get to grips with using markup for content tagging, moving off-template to build your own Hugo themes, and creating custom pages. Next, you’ll push further than you thought was possible with a static site, using JavaScript and the Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) to add functionality like eCommerce and your own APIs. When you’re done, you’ll have the skills to build a stable but feature-rich website without relying on third-party server code.
