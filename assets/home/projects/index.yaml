      Twist to the classic maze game where you control the acceleration and not the speed.

      Created when I was a kid. Lost source code. It has over 30 levels with a proper dragon level in the end, bonus level on every 5 levels and clear instructions on how to play. Windows only. Relive the glorious days of simple indie flash games.
