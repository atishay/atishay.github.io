  content: In various implementations, a computing device is configured to provide a live preview of salient contours generated on a live digital video feed. In particular, a designer can use a computing device with a camera, such as a smart phone, to view a real-time preview of salient contours generated from edges detected in frames of a live digital video feed prior to capture, thereby eliminating the unpredictability of salient contours generated from a previously captured image. In some implementations, the salient contours are overlaid on a greyscale conversion of the live digital video feed for improved processing and visual contrast. Other implementations modify aspects of edge-detecting or post-processing filters for improved performance on mobile computing devices.

- title: Architecture for low overhead customizable routing with pluggable components
  content: |+1
    A modular IOT enabled router with user controllable and pluggable modules. The architecture of the router and plugins allow users to install packet level and application level modules at real time without affecting the latency and router performance. The installed modules are executed in parallel in their own executing unit and in the predefined or user-specified order. The leveled architecture allows fine-grain control of the routing and forwarding internals like QOS, deep packet inspection, encryption, traffic flow control, and traffic filtering via packet level modules. At the same time, it allows running service like a proxy, firewall, web acceleration, ad blocking via application level modules. The full control provides an easy interface for a developer to write plugins for new protocols, SDN, IOT, and user applications and run them in separate controlled execution engine without affecting the core router engine that is running security.
