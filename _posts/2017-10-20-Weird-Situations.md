Toastmasters' table topics are fun. You are picked up unprepared and told to speak on things you never thought you would speak on. We have been working hard to make it more interesting - getting people to really think on the fly by not letting them tapping into their speeches and past table topics by providing interesting situations to speak about. Here are some sample questions I created for a session I hosted. Enjoy.

#### Introduction

Today's topic is around weird situations in life. Our speakers will be told about a weird situation that they have been just been through. They have to tell us how they got out of it:

#### Questions

* You invite someone on a date, but forget your wallet.
* You dropped your roommate/partner on the store while going on a 3 day official trip and accidentally took the house keys with yourself.
* You had a difficult client who after 2 months of hard work finally gives you the check and you spill curry on it.
