What about 10 million in ten years? How about 20 in 20? 100 million in 100 years. Yes. That is what I want to say - there is a time value of money but it is not as huge as is the life value of money. Now is more important than 10 years from now.</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://atishay.me/blog/2016/11/01/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@atishay.me (Atishay Jain)</author><guid>https://atishay.me/blog/2016/11/01/hello-world/</guid><description>The first output of every computer program has traditionally been hello world. That feels like the right way to restart a blog. I have had a website and blogs at multiple times in the past. While resurrecting a website and a blog for myself, I have had some questions that you non-blogger should ask yourself:
Why blog? Why now? What has changed?
Blogging is one of the corner stones of the wild west of the Internet.</description></item></channel></rss>
