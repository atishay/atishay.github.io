abstract="This paper proposes a novel architecture of Internet of Things (IOT) implemented using RFID. Our proposed architecture solves the problem of over-loading as the load on the RFID Tag reader is the total number of changed objects rather than the actual number of objects present. Our architecture is based on EPCglobal Network with some assumptions and modifications. We have discussed in details the components and working of our model. We have also discussed the physical implementation of our model taking the examples of two sample applications one for the retail system and other for smart home applications and their performance results have been tabulated and represented graphically.",
